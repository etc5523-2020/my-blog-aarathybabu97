<p>One of the many things I like about R Shiny is that it provides a wonderful platform to make interactive web applications,therefore I was beyond excited when our class was tasked with creating a web application on COVID-19 using R Shiny for ETC5523. For the said task,I wanted to show the user of my web app, the total number of cases,recoveries and deaths around the world as well as the figures on testing and various demographic trends of COVID-19 in United States,one of the most affected countries in the world by the pandemic. The table depicting the monthly count of cases,recoveries etc around the world also shows information like average life expectancy, population density of the country of userâ€™s choice.The web application mainly focuses on the United States,therefore a choropleth map of the confirmed cases across the states of US is shown along with the trend in COVID-19 testing. The user,can select on each month and observe the percentage of COVID-19 positive and negative cases as well as explore various demographic trends like age,gender and race of COVID-19 positive patients. This blog post is a self review of <a href="https://aarathybabu.shinyapps.io/covid/">my web application</a> as self review is critical for self improvement.</p>

<h2>Self Review</h2>
<p>Though I enjoyed working on the web application in its entirety, the part that I wanted the app user to pay extra attention is the racial and ethnic disparity in COVID-19 cases.Even though, at a glance, from the data on positive cases we see that White Hispanic population is the majority in COVID positive cases but the pattern is totally changed when we take the population of each racial and ethnic group into consideration. The racial and ethnic disparity was made evident through this means and I believe it was one of the things that went well in the shiny app. Another aspect of the app that I believe to have improved the displayed information is the Choropleth map. It not only compares the effect of the pandemic across the states of United States but also aids the user to see the COVID testing trend and subsequent number of positive cases of each month in a particular state that the user chooses. Along with this, another aspect in the app that I believe has went well is in case of the table that displays the COVID-19 cases worldwide. The provision of displaying information on population density,life expectancy on country selected, helps the user to draw insights on comparisons between countries.</p>
<p>To note the areas of improvement, I think the over all styling and layout of the web app could have been improved as well as the quality of the web app could have been improved with some additions to the data used.The section showing demographic trends could have been improved by adding information on ethnic and racial disparity deaths due to COVID-19 which could have explained the true intensity of the effect of the pandemic on various racial and ethnic groups. The COVID-19 testing section could also be improved by approaching from different dimensions,for example including the data on monthly hospitalizations that shows the number of people admitted to ICU as well as ventilator.</p>
