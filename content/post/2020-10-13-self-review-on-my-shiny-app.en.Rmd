One of the many things I like about R Shiny is that it provides a wonderful platform to make interactive web applications,therefore I was beyond excited when our class was tasked with creating a web application on COVID-19 using R Shiny for ETC5523. For the said task,I wanted to show the user of my web app, the total number of cases,recoveries and deaths around the world as well as the figures on testing and various demographic trends of COVID-19 in  United States,one of the most affected countries in the world by the pandemic. The table depicting the monthly count of cases,recoveries etc around the world also shows information like average life expectancy, population density of the country of user's choice.The web application mainly focuses on the United States,therefore a choropleth map of the confirmed cases across the states of US is shown along with the trend in COVID-19 testing. The user,can select on each month and observe the percentage of COVID-19 positive and negative cases as well as explore various demographic trends like age,gender and race of COVID-19 positive patients. This blog post is a self review of [my web application](https://aarathybabu.shinyapps.io/covid/) as self review is critical for self improvement.

## Self Review


Though I enjoyed working on the web application in its entirety, the part that I wanted the app user to pay extra attention is the racial and ethnic disparity in COVID-19 cases.Even though, at a glance, from the data on positive cases we see that White Hispanic population is the majority in COVID positive cases but the pattern is totally changed when we take the population of each racial and ethnic group into consideration. The racial and ethnic disparity was made evident through this means and I believe it was one of the things that went well in the shiny app. Another aspect of the app that I believe to have improved the displayed information is the Choropleth map used to display the confirmed cases in states of US. It not only compares the effect of the pandemic across the states of United States but also aids the user to choose a particular state to see the COVID testing trend and subsequent number of positive cases of each month in that region. Along with this, another aspect in the app that I believe has went well is in case of the table that displays the COVID-19 cases worldwide. The provision of displaying information on population density,life expectancy on country selected, helps the user to draw insights on comparisons between countries.

To note the areas of improvement, I think the over-all styling and layout of the web app could have been improved greatly where as the quality of the web app could have been improved with some additions to the analysis undertaken. A plausible addition to the web app is the exploration of which countries have the high new daily confirmed cases. This would have enabled the user to understand the situation of each country is in while battling the pandemic and that if the country is doing a good job in controlling COVID-19. Also, the quality of the application would have improved if an animated visualization was included that visualizes the spread of the virus around the world. 

Few of the other improvements I would like to add in the app is under the section showing demographic trends. It could be improved by adding information on ethnic and racial disparity in deaths due to COVID-19 which could have explained the true intensity of the effect of the pandemic on various racial and ethnic groups. Similarly, the COVID-19 testing section could also be improved by approaching from different dimensions,for example including the data on monthly hospitalizations that shows the number of people admitted to ICU as well as ventilator.The two former mentioned additions were not possible due to the limitations of the data used in the analysis. The data on hospitalizations had a lot of missing values which posed as a major hurdle in including it to the web application where as the absence of racial identity of the people who died due to COVID-19 in datasets used made it difficult to use deaths as a parameter to measure the intensity of pandemic faced by different population groups in society.

It is very important for the learning process to self assess our work as it helps in looking into things we might have missed while working on the analysis itself. Self assessing the shiny app I made , made me realise that if I work on the app again, I could make the app of even better quality.
